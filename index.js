The issue was caused by the missing `export` statement in the `pages/about.js` file. Next.js requires an `export default` statement to correctly export the component to the routing system.

```javascript
// pages/about.js
function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div>This is the about page</div>
  );
}
export default AboutPage; // Added export statement
```
By adding the `export default AboutPage;` statement, the AboutPage component is correctly exported and the routing issue is resolved.
